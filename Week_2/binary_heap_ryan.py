#how to calculate the index of the parent node
#find index of current node
#since the tree always splits into 2 downwards, the daughter node index is always parent node * 2 +1 | +2
#this *2 is to account for the opposite parent on the other side of the tree and the daughter nodes from one level up
#try drawing it 

def daughter_index(parent_index):
    d1 = parent_index + 1
    d2 = parent_index + 2
    return d1, d2

#the parent index is the opposite, for the odd index, subtract 1 and divide by 2
#for the even index, we take advantage of the truncation done by typecasting int over the float
#this makes it that we can always subtract by 1 and divide by 2 to find the parent instead of checking for even odd

    return int((daughter_index-1)/2)

#all nodes have maximum child nodes other than last level
